        <title>what's in my bag </title>
        <!-- In my harmonic collection I’m interested in looking at the items left behind in my bags 
            to see what can be learned about myself and my habits through the capturing and cataloging 
            of these forgotten items. I would like my website to function as an archive of all items, 
            featuring a kind of culminating glossary of all items left behind. Over 10 entries I’ll go 
            through 10 bags and their items and experiment with methods of capture, cataloging, and 
            display. I’m drawn to scanning or creating PNGs to capture the bag’s contents. 
            The website’s design should encapsulate the bag, and its navigation should be interactive, 
            with many menus and organizational elements to give the feeling of rifling through a bag. 
            I’m interested in finding a way to organize what is unorganized through code and web design. 
            What elements function as containers for information? How can a bag be represented through 
            code? The bag is a vessel for items, just as some HTML elements contain other elements 
            within themselves. These items are hidden within the structure of the bag, but when opened 
            more information is revealed. The bag has the ability to contain the unorganized contents 
            inside.In my first entry I wanted to see how HTML elements could be used to organize the 
            messy contents of my unorganized bag. My goal was to code something that could replicate the 
            act of opening my bag. In this entry I used details/summary as the bag’s zipper – an 
            interactive element that reveals hidden information. Within the hidden information is an 
            unorganized list of what I found in the bag I used this week. I included additional information 
            about the items like how long they’d been in the bag and how it ended up there. -->
